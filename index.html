									<p>During a pandemic, more than in any other public health situation,
										information systems
										play a key role in managing the data and information required in
										the speed that the situation
										requires. They are also key to having
										evidence for action, make the the most of
										informed decisions and adapt policies that allow
										better intelligence in health actions.
										<br>
										<br>
										On the other
										hand, emerging technologies and the possibilities
										they offer can mean
										public health benefits like never before in
										the history of mankind.
										Information systems allow access and
										immediate, agile and coordinated data exchange and
										prioritization of care, access and response, especially to those who are in a 
										situation of
									    vulnerability.
										<br>
										<br>
										Properly shared health data allows planning actions that
										reduce possible health inequities at different levels of care and facilitate the
										implementation of strategies to address them.
										<br>
										<br>
										For this reason, our group of Health,
										Medical Informatics and Languages specialists ​​joins this effort by sharing health information
										obtained from certified scientific publications, using some of the technologies now
										available globally as platforms.
										<br>
										<br>
										We can not stand idly by, so we sincerely hope that our modest contribution will be
										useful for those seeking documented and understandable health information in
										these hard times.

									<h2>Coronavirus Updates: Kids' vaccines are coming soon</h2>
									
									<p>Pharmaceutical companies Pfizer and BioNTech on Thursday submitted an application 
										to the Food and Drug Administration, seeking emergency use authorization for 
										their coronavirus vaccine for children 5 to 11 years old. A vaccination campaign 
										for these young children is expected to begin as soon as early November. 
										The government has purchased enough of the Pfizer 
										vaccine to give two doses to each of the 28 million children in this age group.</p>

									</h2>Cautious welcome for malaria vaccine</h2>
									<p>Researchers are celebrating the historic news that the World Health Organization (WHO)
										has recommended the roll out of the RTS,S malaria vaccine among children under age 
										five in Africa. But there are challenges ahead: the vaccine, also known as Mosquirix, 
										has shown only modest efficacy, and requires a complex regimen of doses. Some 
										researchers fear that the move will overshadow existing malaria control measures that 
										are often underfunded, such as insecticide programmes and functional health systems. 
										Nevertheless, researchers are grateful for the WHO’s decision. “With the devastation 
										of COVID-19, and with progress stalled on malaria control, and news of resistance to 
										anti-malaria drugs, it’s uplifting to see some positive news,” says epidemiologist 
										James Tibenderana.

									<h2>
										‘Historic moment’ for malaria vaccine</h2>
									<p> (WHO) has recommended that a malaria vaccine be distributed widely across Africa. 
										RTS,S is the first proven vaccine against the shape-shifting malaria parasite, but it 
										has its limits: it prevents only roughly 30% of severe cases in children, and it requires 
										4 injections over 18 months. It’s also relatively expensive, despite manufacturer 
										GlaxoSmithKline offering a discount, following a three-decades-long, multimillion-dollar 
										development programme. The approval demonstrates how valuable any bulwark is against the 
										parasites, which kill an estimated 260,000 young children in Africa every year and are 
										unusually good at evading the immune response. "We've been looking for a malaria vaccine 
										for over 100 years now,” Pedro Alonso, the director of the WHO Global Malaria Programme, 
										told the BBC. “It will save lives and prevent disease in African children.”

									<h2>
										Why COVID science didn’t win a Nobel</h2>
									
										<p>Some scientists expressed surprise and disappointment that none of this year’s Nobel 
											prizes were awarded to COVID-19 vaccines, particularly those developed using 
											messenger-RNA (mRNA) technology, which have launched a new class of vaccine. The 
											timing of nominations — which must be submitted by 1 February — might be a factor. 
											So too is the question of how mRNA technology will kick off research into vaccines 
											against other diseases. “We want to give credit to the right people. And for the right 
											discovery,” says Göran Hansson, secretary-general of the Royal Swedish Academy of 
											Sciences in Stockholm, which selects the prize winners. “So stay tuned.”

									<h2>Filters could clean SARS-CoV-2 from air</h2>
									<p>Research at a hospital in the United Kingdom suggests that portable HEPA air filters 
										effectively remove SARS-CoV-2 virus particles from the air — the first such evidence in a 
										real-world setting. The results indicate that air filters might be an affordable and 
										overlooked tool to reduce the risk of COVID-19 transmission in hospitals.

											<p>Based on scientific trials from around the world, experts say that COVID-19 vaccines that 
												have reported results have shown to be over 90% effective at preventing hospitalization 
												and death. This includes vaccines with lower efficacy rates, which reflects how well the 
												vaccine works in a controlled setting, and does not account for a vaccine's ability to 
												prevent serious illness.</p>
